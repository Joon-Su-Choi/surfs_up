# Surf's Up

## Overview of the Analysis

We are identifying temperature trends before opening a surf shop. We are looking at the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

We have isolated the results of the temperatures in Oahu during the months of June and December into the following dataframes.

- The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 3.26. The lowest temperature it has been is 64 degrees fahrenheit with a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit.

- The average temperature in June is 71.04 degrees fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 3.75. The lowest temperature it has been is 56 degrees fahrenheit with a high of 83 degrees fahrenheit.
- The average temperature difference between the two months is 3.90 degrees fahrenheit and the difference in standard deviation is 0.49. These margins are quite small for such a difference in time span.

## Summary

The difference in average temperature in June and December seems to be quite small. Having an average temperature of 71 to 74 degress fahrenheit seems like it would be a good oppurtunity to open up a surf shop. We are looking for business all year round and having a consistent warm temperature is good for the business. However, before opening up the business it would be wise to run additional queries that we have not yet factored. A query to check the overall levels of precipitation would be beneficial. We know that the old surf shop was rained out of business so we do not want to repeat this occurence. Another query we can run would be the median temperature for the months of June and December. Also finding how often the low end of temperatures occured for the days of these months and how many of the high end of the temperatures. These averages show overall good, warm weather but this data can be skewed depending on very high temperatures for just a select few days of the months.
